# Who am I?

Hello everyone! Welcome to my web page.

I am Heesun from Korea and studying electrical engineering in TU Berlin. My motto is "Your time is limited, so don't waste it in other people's lives!" Can you guess what kind of MBTI I am?

I can say that I am a very goal-oriented and organized person.
Sometimes it can look boring. But I really like organizing, and I want to know where things are, where I am, and what I'm doing. I also like to have new experiences. As long as I don't get too old, I want to keep trying new things.

Then enjoy my web page!

안뇽!
