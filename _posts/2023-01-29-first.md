# Introduction about myself

Hello everyone! Welcome to my web page.

I am Heesun from Korea and studying in Berlin. My motto is "Your time is limited, so don't waste it in other people's lives!" Can you guess what kind of MBTI I am?

I can say that I am a very goal-oriented and organized person.
Sometimes it can look boring. But I really like organizing, and I want to know where things are, where I am, and what I'm doing. I also like to have new experiences. As long as I don't get too old, I want to keep trying new things.

With that perspective, Berlin is the perfect city. You can experience new things every day, and it is full of interesting people who inspire you. I am happy and grateful to live in Berlin. Berlin is always open, and I'm sure most of you will fall in love with Berlin.

Then enjoy my web page!

안뇽!
